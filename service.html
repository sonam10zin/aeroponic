            <h3>3D Scanning</h3>
            <p>Thanks to the latest technologies, 3D scanning allows you to create extremely precise scans with an accuracy of up to 0. 05 mm. Measurements are made for both small and large models, from 0. 05 m to 4 m. It is possible to obtain a detailed 3D model for almost every object, which at a later stage can be processed in a CAD program and printed on a 3D printer.</p>
